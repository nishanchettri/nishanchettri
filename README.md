# Hi There! 👋

## About Me 💁🏻‍♂️
I'm Nishan Chettri, a PhD student in [Micro and Nano Electronics](https://phd-mne.unipv.it/index.php?page=Students.php) at the [Integrated Microsystems and Sensors Lab](http://ims2.unipv.it), [University of Pavia, Italy](https://web.unipv.it).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Readout circuits for Light to Digital Conversion for Photoplethysmography.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Current Mode ADCs.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source IC design.
- 💬 Ask me about: Anything related to data converters and analogue IC design.
