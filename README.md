## About Me 💁🏻‍♂️
I'm Nishan Chettri, a PhD student in [Micro and Nano Electronics](https://phd-mne.unipv.it/index.php?page=Students.php) at the [Integrated Microsystems and Sensors Lab](http://ims2.unipv.it), [University of Pavia, Italy](https://web.unipv.it).

## Introduction 💬
Welcome to my GitHub page! Here, I aim to organize useful materials for those working or studying in the field of Electronic Engineering. Whether you're looking for past ISSCC courses, free courses, basic projects, building block designs, Cadence tutorials, PhD Positions or interview questions, you'll find something here. I update this page on a weekly basis, so stay tuned!
