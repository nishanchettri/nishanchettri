## Study Material

Here, I organize a study roadmap for people interested in Analog & Mixed-Signal design, based on my experience & what I studied before:

- Analog Design Basics
- Digital Circuits Basics
- PLLs (Phase-Locked Loops)
- ADCs (Analog/Digital Converters)
- LDOs (Low-Dropout Regulators)
- RF receiver system
- IO/SERDES system

### Layout
- Cadence Tutorials
- Razavi References
- Razavi AnalogMind Articles - [drive](#)
